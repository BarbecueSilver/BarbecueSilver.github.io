In a team of four, we had several months to implement a collaborative drawing software for a tabletop touch screen. It was fun! My first bigger project.</p><p>Next was station was a CAD company. They use C# as well. I was used to live in a universe of typed variables and method. It was comfortable. It saved me a lot of time. I was not aware of this luxury, until ...</p><p>I joined a company which offers several web applications: Welcome to the jungle! The relentless wilderness. Before I was walking on a warm and bright summers day in a beautiful city. Everything around me was crisp and crystal clear. Suddenly I was in a dark street at night. I didn&apos;t know what was around the next corner. There could be a mob, which is ready for everything, just another dark street, an open cozy restaurant or ... just nothingness ... you just fall. JavaScript.</p><p>At some time I got used to the darkness around me. My eyes go better in the dark. I knew when I needed to peek around the corner for nothingness. But still ... it was dark here. </p><p>The dawn has broken. There was light at the end of the tunnel. Everything began with three characters: <em>any</em>. C# was back again, but it had a different name: TypeScript.</p><p>Converting a project from JavaScript to TypeScript can be hard. The path may be brutal and exhausting. You discover bugs which you never thought of. They were there all the time. You never noticed.</p><p>I want to encourage you to take the learning curve. Try TS in a small project. You will love it. The &quot;careless coding&quot; of JS costs you much more than creating meaningful types in TS.</p><p>No more guessing.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
